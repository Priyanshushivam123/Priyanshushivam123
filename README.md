# 🚦 Multi-threaded Traffic Signal System

## 📄 Description
This project simulates a real-time traffic signal control system using multi-threading in Java. The system dynamically switches traffic lights based on simulated or image-processed traffic conditions, improving traffic flow efficiency.

## 💡 Features
- Real-time signal switching using threads  
- Dynamic priority allocation based on traffic conditions  
- Image/video processing to detect traffic density *(if implemented)*  
- Thread synchronization for smooth signal transitions  
- GUI-based signal status display *(if applicable)*

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Java  
- Java Threads (Multithreading)  
- OpenCV (if used)  
- Swing / JavaFX *(if GUI is implemented)*  
- MySQL with JDBC *(if database used)*
